[1mSYNOPSIS[0m[m
       [1mps[0m [[4moptions[24m][m
[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mps[0m displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed information, use [1mtop[0m[m
       instead.[m
[m
       This version of [1mps[0m accepts several kinds of options:[m
[m
       1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.[m
       2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.[m
       3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.[m
[m
       Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can appear.  There are some synonymous options, which are functionally identical, due to the[m
       many standards and [1mps[0m implementations that this [1mps[0m is compatible with.[m
[m
       Note that [1mps[0m [1m-aux[0m is distinct from [1mps[0m [1maux[0m.  The POSIX and UNIX standards require that [1mps[0m [1m-aux[0m print all processes owned by a user named [4mx[24m, as well as[m
       printing all processes that would be selected by the [1m-a[0m option.  If the user named [4mx[24m does not exist, this [1mps[0m may interpret the command as [1mps[0m [1maux[0m instead and[m
       print a warning.  This behavior is intended to aid in transitioning old scripts and habits.  It is fragile, subject to change, and thus should not be relied[m
       upon.[m
[m
       By default, [1mps[0m selects all processes with the same effective user ID (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same terminal as the invoker.[m
       It displays the process ID (pid=PID), the terminal associated with the process (tname=TTY), the cumulated CPU time in [DD-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and[m
       the executable name (ucmd=CMD).  Output is unsorted by default.[m
[m
       The use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT) to the default display and show the command args (args=COMMAND) instead of the executable[m
       name.  You can override this with the [1mPS_FORMAT[0m environment variable.  The use of BSD-style options will also change the process selection to include[m
       processes on other terminals (TTYs) that are owned by you; alternately, this may be described as setting the selection to be the set of all processes[m
       filtered to exclude processes owned by other users or not on a terminal.  These effects are not considered when options are described as being "identical"[m
       below, so [1m-M[0m will be considered identical to [1mZ[0m and so on.[m
[m
       Except as described below, process selection options are additive.  The default selection is discarded, and then the selected processes are added to the set[m
       of processes to be displayed.  A process will thus be shown if it meets any of the given selection criteria.[m
